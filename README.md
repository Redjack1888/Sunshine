# Sunshine
Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course **_[Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853)_** and part of the **Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Dev 2017/2018**.

## _Project Overview_
The main screen is a list of forecast information with an emphasized presentation for the forecast for today's weather.
We have icons to indicate conditions like snow, rain, fog or sunshine.

With the click on one of the forecast, we bring up a detailed view containing the rest of the weathery goodness. This view also gives us the opportunity
to share the weather with our friends.

We can go to settings and change the units of measure as well as the location.

The app will post system wide notifications to let us know about weather conditions without even entering the app.

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time!
